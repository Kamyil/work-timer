# What is this?
Work Timer is completely open-source, fast and superlightweight app which allows you to track the time of your work. The idea is simple => Put the task which you want to work with => hit the work button and keep working. When you finish the task click "It's Done" button, and app will tell you how much time you spend on it. Also this app can generate the workday/workweek reports with full info of your work. Enjoy :)   

# Motivation

There are a lot of companies, which use task systems like JIRA. The biggest struggle for teammembers in these systems
is time measurement. Most often it's distracting teammembers from their work and they spend a lot of time to calculate
time spent on each task.   

# Yay!
Now, with this app you don't have to make another bullshit Excel sheet. Work-timer will do all of 
this stuff for you :)

# Installing

It might shock you, but this app doesn't need any installation process. All of the files required to run, are in production folder.

### ... but

We're developers and we know, that everything can just fail for not certainly reason.

### so...

If it happens, hit `npm install` to let app install all required packages to run. 
And then:

### if you want to run this with console locally
Just call the app with `npm start` . App after build proccess will open himself in your default browser
**BUT WARNING!!! IF YOU'RE NOT DEVELOPER => DON'T CHANGE THE FILES IN /DEVELOPMENT folder. YOU CAN DESTROY THE APP BY EDITING THEM**


### if you want to run this by opening the file
Eveything should work fine without any installation, so open the index.html file in /production folder.

###TODO 

Here's our simple to-do list. Here we can show you on which feature we're working right now and what's already done. Go ahead and 
type your ideas to improve this cool tool. 

# ENJOY :)
